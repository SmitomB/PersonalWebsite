I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. Daniel Obenour](https://www.ccee.ncsu.edu/people/drobenou/) in the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering at NC State. My research interest lies in modeling the biogeochemical processes related to eutrophication in inland water systems and understanding how different management strategies as well as climate change can affect these processes. My keen interest in biogeochemical modeling has its roots in my masterâ€™s program that allowed me to experience firsthand how changes in the land use patterns and climate over the years can negatively affect civilization and wildlife in a deteriorating wetland. These experiences made me realize that to design effective restoration of an ecosystem, there must be strong local leadership and a proper mechanism to transfer technical know-how to practical implementation. I wish to build a career in academia and work closely with governmental agencies and the public to develop sustainable solutions to several water quality problems.
