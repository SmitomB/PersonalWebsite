I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. Daniel Obenour](https://www.ccee.ncsu.edu/people/drobenou/) in the [Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ccee.ncsu.edu/) at NC State University. My primary research interest lies in modeling nutrient dynamics in terrestrial and aquatic systems, with a special emphasis on climate change and management implications. During my PhD program, I have developed several data-driven models, including mechanistic and machine learning models, to simulate the phosphorus dynamics in freshwater systems. In particular, my research focuses on internal nutrient loading, which is often ignored in lake and reservoir management programs but can be a significant contributor towards eutrophication.
